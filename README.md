## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS 3D Analyst extension

Downloaded dataset that had this
Then I had to transform the 2D map into a 3D map and later set the extrsuion of the buildings 
Joined tables to tranfer attributes for the exact accurate building heights using the join field tool
Created multipatch layers for the look of buildings and their shapes through the symbology pane using a rule package file (RPK)
Added in data for water and make it into a realistic 3D representation of how it looks like in real life in the symbology pane. After that, I set the illumination setting to set the 3D scene into certain lighting.


Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
